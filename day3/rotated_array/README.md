I realized this afterwards but the easy solution is not valid since the problem specifically says that the code must be O(log n)

And yeah the hardest part of the problem was keeping it under O(log n) time complexity, It took me quite some time trying to work out the logic for finding the pivot point while still being under the time constraint, and I probably wouldn't have worked this one out without first referencing stuff online.

You can really see how much faster it is by comparing the runtimes of the easy and the normal solution even though the index method in the easy solution runs on a c backend which is very fast but still doesn't beat the O(log n) solution
