Initially I was using a simple iterative method as seen in commit [82875b5](https://github.com/Sankalp-G/10-days-of-code/blob/82875b5dcd874cb6e2693f673461017223311f1f/day5/find_duplicate.rb) but yeah that doesn't pass one of the test cases due to the time limit.

Hardest part of the problem was keeping it under O(1) space complexity as required by the question, which reduced a lot of the options that you could take.
